# **Iterables II:**

## **Assignment:**

The starting point for this project is the Polygon class and the Polygons sequence type we created in the <a href="https://github.com/m-shilpa/EPAI/tree/main/Session_10_Sequence_Types">here</a>.

### **Goal :**
Refactor the Polygons (sequence) type, into an iterable.You'll need to implement both an iterable, and an iterator.

## Classes and Functions

### **Polygon Class:**

This class provides the properties of a polygon such as vertex, circum radius, interior angle, edge length , apothem, area and perimeter.

### **Polygon Sequence Class:**

This class is used to get a sequence of polygons.

### **PolygonIter Class:**

This Class is an iterator which helps to iter over the objects in the Polygon Sequence and calculate them on the fly instead of pre-calculating them.
